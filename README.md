# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview

Use data visualization techniques to give insight into the data from a ride sharing company called PyBer.

## Resources

* Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
* Software: Python 3.7.7, Anaconda Navigator 1.9.12, Jupyter Notebook 6.0.3

## Challenge Overview

Youâ€™ve been asked by your CEO to create an overall snapshot of the ride-sharing data. She would like to see a summary table of key metrics of the ride-sharing data by city type, and a multiple-line graph that shows the average fare for each week by each city type.

## Results

### DataFrame Summary

The dataframe summary for ridesharing tells us a number of things.

> There are significantly more rides in Urban cities than Suburban or Rural. 
> The average fare per ride and average fare per driver are actally most expensive in the rural areas and cheaper in the Urban cities.
> This tells us that as a ride share service has more drivers available, the ride expenses or fares become cheaper on average.

### Multiline Graph Summary

The multiline graph gives a nice visualiation of the ride share data.
